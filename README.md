### A small react project made to understand react fundamentals like State, Event & Form Submission

It allows travelers to add items they need for their next trip
The app will display the items that are added and packed and have a sort-by option.
We will have a footer that displays the number of items on the list, the number of items 
that have been packed, and the percentage of items that have been packed. If there are no items 
in the list, the component will display a message asking the user to add some items.
